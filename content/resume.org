* About

When I was introduced to the web it was early days. A web site was a HTML file
and maybe a CGI scripts. Things changed quickly and soon php and server side
frameworks where on my radar. The amount of power that the web could provide was
growing.

I learned the hacks necessary to create usable interfaces. Table layouts and
sliding door tabs anyone? It was not fun and fun at the same time. I'm glad we
are past the days of transparent gifs and what not. I was on board when the CSS
Revolution started.

- Design & Layout
- Markup & CSS
- Custom CMS updates PHP & SQL

The Henri Lloyd Online project was a redesign project with a handfull of CMS
custom updates. I created the initial layout and design tools using atomic
design principles. After approval from the client I did the primary markup and
CSS. This required modification of the CMS. The CMS was custom tiny PHP
applications that required new SQL querys and php functions to dispaly new
elements and features of the redesign.

R&D project was a redsign project that allowed the use of newer css design tools
like flexbox but maintain backwards compatability - a major concern for R&D
whoâ€™s customers frequently run legacy systems.
